# Welcome to What the WFF!

This is a guide to help you understand the rules of logic and solve proofs in the app.

## Rules of Inference

The app uses standard rules of inference to build logical proofs. Here are a few examples:

*   **Modus Ponens:** If you have `P → Q` and `P`, you can conclude `Q`.
*   **Conjunction:** If you have `P` and you have `Q`, you can conclude `P ∧ Q`.

### Details
You can tap on any premise or derived line to use it in a subsequent step. Select the rule 
you want to apply and the app will validate your choice.
